# PCG Random Number Generator, AVM Edition

## lib-pcg-pyteal
This [AlgoKit](http://algokit.io) subproject implements PCG in [PyTeal](https://pyteal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
For more general info on this library, see the [main page](../..).

## Getting Started
Copy both the [pcg32](./lib_pcg/pcg32.py) and the [pcg64](./lib_pcg/pcg64.py)
files in your own projectâ€™s `lib_pcg` folder.

Import the library in your contracts like:

```python
...
from lib_pcg.pcg32 import pcg32_init, pcg32_random

...


@app.external
def your_method(...) -> ...:
  # Here you would acquire a safe randomness seed
  ...

  # Create a ScratchVar that holds your PRNG state
  rng_handle = pt.ScratchVar(pt.TealType.uint64)

  return pt.Seq(
    # Seed the PRNG
    pcg32_init(rng_handle.index(), seed.get()),

    # Generate a sequence
    output.decode(
      pcg32_random(
        rng_handle.index(),
        pt.Int(32),
        lower_bound.get(),
        upper_bound.get(),
        length.get(),
      )
    ),
  )
```
You can also take a look at the exposer contracts:

  [2](./smart_contracts/lib_pcg64_exposer/contract.py)
]

## Discontinuing the PyTeal Implementation
When this project was started, PyTeal was the first language that this library was implemented in.
This was due to the maturity of other languages at that time, and also the fact that PyTeal allows for intricate tricks
over inlining and other optimizations.

However, the PyTeal implementation will see less and less support in the future,
as other languages mature more and become more popular.
Right now, this implementation serves as a good soundness and performance benchmark and can be considered in maintenance mode.
We will drop support entirely at some point.

## Usage
Due to internal details, the `8 / 16 / 32`-bit generators all use `pcg32_init()` for seeding the algorithms,
but then you should use the respective `pcg8/16/32_random()` function to get your sequence.
This will change in the future to prevent ambiguity.

`64`-bit generator uses the respective `pcg64_init()` function.

You can pass non-zero `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` arguments to `pcg<N>_random()` to get integers in a desired range.  
Note that:
- `lower_bound` is always included in your range.
- `upper_bound` is always excluded by your range.
- You can set them independently.
- The range should be at least two elements wide.

When either bound is set to zero, that bound is not applied.

## Feature Support
- [ ] Package published on PyPI
- [x] `8 / 16 / 32`-bit generator
- [x] `64`-bit generator
- [x] `128`-bit generator (kind of)

Since PyTeal does not support `128`-bit integers, we use a `StaticBytes[Literal[16]]` in place of that.
This makes the interface not compatible with all other implementations, but it's still subject to the same tests.
